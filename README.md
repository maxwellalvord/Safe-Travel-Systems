### Description
This is a passion project that is currently in development as a project to put my NEXT.js skills to use. Safe Travel Systems aims to provide a Friendly UI and database to allow users to search and save information for their travels that might prove useful. The application of NEXT.js allows for an effecient framework of "pages" that are dynamically rendered. The ultimate goal was to use Vercel (NEXT.js deployment tool) to deploy the site stress free. 

## Live Site
* Bypass all setup and installation by visiting the live site at <a href='https://safe-travel-systems.vercel.app/'>Safe-Travel-Systems</a> (https://safe-travel-systems.vercel.app/)!

## Setup/Installation
* Clone this Repo : <https://github.com/maxwellalvord/Safe-Travel-Systems>
* cd into Safe-Travel-Systems

In the project directory (Safe-Travel-Systems), you can run:

### `npm run dev`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run lint`

(if you have any issues running the program try reinstalling the packages with npm install.)

## Known Bugs
* Input type textarea not rendering correctly.
* Hydration Error in Dev environment, all styling still renders correctly.
* Partial incorrect font render on live site.
* Render is squished in mobile version.
