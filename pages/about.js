        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>I am a Developer from Portland Oregon who grew up with early mornings on the ski hill and late nights out with friends. As I have gotten older my hometown and mountain have become places I call home, provoking curiosity of what the rest of the world has for me. From their I've developed the idea to have a website where users with the same aspirations as me can look in one place for all the information they might need in travels in an unknown land</p>
